Subject: URGENT Something wrong with our employee directory!

Hello!

I've been adding features to our new Employee Directory Flask App!
I followed your instructions. I:

- set up my own virtualenv
- activated it
- installed all the requirements with pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- ran it with python3 directory.py

and it ran!

But my edits in the HTML files... well... could you take a look in the
templates folder to see what's happening with them?

The search form on the main page (home.html) doesn't work anymore. When I
search for a name and press enter, it's supposed to connect to the employee
details page, but instead it says the page is "Not Found".

And my new edits to that employee details page (employee_details.html) are
GREAT. I haven't been able to see them because of that broken route, but I
bet they look fine. I probably saved you a lot of time, but you can make it
up by coming in this weekend and filing some paperwork for me. Just in case,
could you fix up any errors you see on the details page? Now that I think
about it, I might have mixed up a few Jinja variables....

Thanks,
Mel

# To Do
1. Figure out why the “Page Not Found” error is happening and fix it.

2. Fix Mel’s Jinja formatting errors.

Hint: There should only be two Jinja fixes needed.

# Further Study
1. Read through PEP 8. If you have read it already, give it another skim through: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

2. Also, here is a list of Flask extensions. Take a look and see what’s out there: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/extensions/
